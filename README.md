## Getting Started
(Please note that this guide will assume that wsl or some other linux based terminal is used, and not windows)

### Prerequisites
First ensure that python3 and pip are installed.

To check, run these commands (seperately) in your terminal:
```
python3 --version
pip --version
```

If you do not have `python3` or `pip`, run these commands (seperately) to install:
```
sudo apt update && upgrade
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
